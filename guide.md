### Getting Started: Uploading Your Data

When you open the application, you'll see the welcome screen.

1.  **(Optional) Download Resources:**
    * **CSV Data Template:** If it's your first time or your data isn't ready, download this template. It contains all necessary columns (`BPS`, `Team Leader`, `Task 1`, `Task 2`, etc.) and an example row to guide you. Fill this template with your team's information.
    * **Task Reference Guide:** Download a simple plain text list with the ID and name of each task (skill) assessed. Useful for understanding what each `Task X` refers to when filling out the template.
2.  **Upload Data File:**
    * Drag and drop your CSV file (either the one filled using the template or one you already have in that format) into the designated area, or click to browse for it on your computer.
    * The application will automatically process the file. If everything is correct, it will take you to the main dashboard. If there are errors (e.g., incorrect format, missing columns), it will display a message asking you to review your file.
